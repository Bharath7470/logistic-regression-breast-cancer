# 🩺 Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

This project was done as part of my internship (Task 4) to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression.

## 📊 Objective
Classify tumors as **Malignant (1)** or **Benign (0)** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🧠 Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Label Encoding of Target (`diagnosis`)
- Train-Test Split (80/20)
- Feature Scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Logistic Regression Model
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- ROC Curve & AUC Score

## ✅ Results
- High accuracy and precision
- AUC score close to 1 (excellent performance)
- ROC curve shows strong classification capability

## 📁 Files Included
- `Logistic_Regression_Breast_Cancer.ipynb`: The main notebook
- `data.csv`: The dataset used
